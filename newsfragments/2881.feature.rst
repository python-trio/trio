`TypeVarTuple <https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVarTuple>`_ is now used to fully type :meth:`nursery.start_soon() <trio.Nursery.start_soon>`, :func:`trio.run()`, :func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync()`, and other similar functions accepting ``(func, *args)``. This means type checkers will be able to verify types are used correctly. :meth:`nursery.start() <trio.Nursery.start>` is not fully typed yet however.

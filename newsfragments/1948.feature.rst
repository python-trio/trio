Make :class:`~.Event` more lightweight by using less objects (about 2 rather
than 5, including a nested ParkingLot and attribute dicts) and simpler
structures (set rather than OrderedDict).  This may benefit applications that
create a large number of event instances, such as with the "replace event
object on every set()" idiom.

Added the concept of a "tree variable" (`trio.TreeVar`), which is like
a context variable except that its value in a new task is inherited
from the new task's parent nursery rather than from the task that
spawned it.  (The `~trio.TreeVar` behavior matches the existing
:ref:`behavior of cancel scopes <child-tasks-and-cancellation>`.)
This distinction makes tree variables useful for anything that's
naturally inherited along parent/child task relationships, such as a
reference to a resource that has a limited lifetime.

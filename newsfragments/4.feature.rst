Initial :ref:`subprocess support <subprocess>`.
Add :class:`trio.subprocess.Process`, an async wrapper around the stdlib
:class:`subprocess.Popen` class, which permits spawning subprocesses
and communicating with them over standard Trio streams.
:mod:`trio.subprocess` also reexports all the stdlib :mod:`subprocess`
exceptions and constants for convenience.

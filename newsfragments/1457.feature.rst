When exiting a nursery block, the parent task always waits for child
tasks to exit. This wait cannot be cancelled. However, previously, if
you tried to cancel it, it *would* inject a `Cancelled` exception,
even though it wasn't cancelled. Most users probably never noticed
either way, but injecting a `Cancelled` here is not really useful, and
in some rare cases caused confusion or problems, so Trio no longer
does that.

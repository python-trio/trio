If you want to use :ref:`guest mode <guest-mode>`, but you can't
easily arrange to start and finish your Trio run while the host loop
is running, then you're in luck: the newly added :ref:`"inside-out
guest mode" <inside-out-guest-mode>` allows you to run the host loop
from within an existing Trio program instead, by calling
:func:`trio.lowlevel.become_guest_for`.  This is implemented using the
same machinery as the existing (right-side-in?)  guest mode, and
unlocks additional ways for Trio to interoperate with other loops.

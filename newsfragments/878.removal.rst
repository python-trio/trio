Give up on trying to have different low-level waiting APIs on Unix and
Windows. All platforms now have `trio.hazmat.wait_readable`,
`trio.hazmat.wait_writable`, and `trio.hazmat.notify_closing`. The old
platform-specific synonyms ``wait_socket_*``,
``notify_socket_closing``, and ``notify_fd_closing`` have been
deprecated.

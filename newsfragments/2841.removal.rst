To better reflect the underlying thread handling semantics,
the keyword argument for `trio.to_thread.run_sync` that was
previously called ``cancellable`` is now named ``abandon_on_cancel``.
It still does the same thing -- allow the thread to be abandoned
if the call to `trio.to_thread.run_sync` is cancelled -- but since we now
have other ways to propagate a cancellation without abandoning
the thread, "cancellable" has become somewhat of a misnomer.
The old ``cancellable`` name is now deprecated.

We've slightly relaxed our definition of which Trio operations act as
:ref:`checkpoints <checkpoint-rule>`. A Trio async function that exits by
throwing an exception is no longer guaranteed to execute a checkpoint;
it might or might not. The rules are unchanged for async functions that
don't exit with an exception, async iterators, and async context managers.
:func:`trio.testing.assert_checkpoints` has been updated to reflect the
new behavior: if its ``with`` block exits with an exception, no assertion
is made.

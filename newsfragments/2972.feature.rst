Added an interactive interpreter ``python -m trio``.

This makes it easier to try things and experiment with trio in the a python repl. Use the
``await`` keyword without needing to call ``trio.run()``

 .. code-block:: console
    $ python -m trio
    Trio 0.21.0+dev, Python 3.10.6
    Use "await" directly instead of "trio.run()".
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import trio
    >>> await trio.sleep(1); print("hi")  # prints after one second
    hi

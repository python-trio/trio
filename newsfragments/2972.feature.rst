Added an interactive interpreter ``python -m trio``.

This makes it easier to try things and experiment with trio in the a Python repl.
Use the ``await`` keyword without needing to call ``trio.run()``

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m trio
   Trio 0.21.0+dev, Python 3.10.6
   Use "await" directly instead of "trio.run()".
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import trio
   >>> await trio.sleep(1); print("hi")  # prints after one second
   hi

Trio now gives a reasonable traceback and error message in most cases
when its invariants surrounding cancel scope nesting have been
violated. (One common source of such violations is an async generator
that yields within a cancel scope.) The previous behavior was an
inscrutable chain of TrioInternalErrors.

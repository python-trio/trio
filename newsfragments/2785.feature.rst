New helper classes: :class:`~.testing.RaisesGroup` and :class:`~.testing.Matcher`.

In preparation for changing the default of ``strict_exception_groups`` to `True`, we're introducing a set of helper classes that can be used in place of `pytest.raises <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest.raises>`_ in tests, to check for an expected `ExceptionGroup`.
These are provisional, and only planned to be supplied until there's a good solution in ``pytest``. See https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11538

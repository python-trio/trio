There is a new "task_raised" instrumentation.
    
The use case: One of your tasks raises an exception. The nursery cancels
all other tasks and waits for them to end. If one of these tasks swallows
the cancellation, e.g. because of a deadlock, you may need a way to find
the original exception (and the task it was raised in) to see what's going
on.

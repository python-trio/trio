There are a number of methods on :class:`trio.ssl.SSLStream` that
report information about the negotiated TLS connection, like
``selected_alpn_protocol``, and thus cannot succeed until after the
handshake has been performed. Previously, we returned None from these
methods, like the stdlib :mod:`ssl` module does, but this is
confusing, because that can also be a valid return value. Now we raise
:exc:`trio.ssl.NeedHandshakeError` instead.

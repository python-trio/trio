With ``strict_exception_groups=True``, when you ran a function in a nursery which raised an exception before calling ``task_status.started()``, it previously got wrapped twice over in ``ExceptionGroup`` in some cases. It no longer does that, and also won't wrap any ``ExceptionGroup`` raised by the function itself.

open_memory_channel() now returns a named tuple with attributes ``send_channel``
and ``receive_channel``.  This can be used to avoid indexed access of the
channel halves in some scenarios such as a collection of channels.  (Note: when
dealing with a single memory channel, assigning the send and receive halves
to separate variables via destructuring is still considered more readable.)

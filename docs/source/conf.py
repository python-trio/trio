# Sphinx is very finicky, and somewhat buggy, so we have several different
# methods to help it resolve links.
# 1. The ones that are not possible to fix are added to `nitpick_ignore`
# 2. some can be resolved with a simple alias in `autodoc_type_aliases`,
#    even if that is primarily meant for TypeAliases
# 3. autodoc_process_signature is hooked up to an event, and we use it for
#    whole-sale replacing types in signatures where internal details are not
#    relevant or hard to read.
# 4. add_intersphinx manually modifies the intersphinx mappings after
#    objects.inv has been parsed, to resolve bugs and version differences
#    that causes some objects to be looked up incorrectly.
# 5. docs/source/typevars.py handles redirecting `typing_extensions` objects to `typing`, and linking `TypeVar`s to `typing.TypeVar` instead of sphinx wanting to link them to their individual definitions.
# It's possible there's better methods for resolving some of the above
# problems, but this works for now:tm:

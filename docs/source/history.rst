Trio 0.10.0 (2019-01-07)
------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Initial :ref:`subprocess support <subprocess>`. Add
  :class:`trio.subprocess.Process <trio.Process>`, an async wrapper around the stdlib
  :class:`subprocess.Popen` class, which permits spawning subprocesses and
  communicating with them over standard Trio streams. ``trio.subprocess``
  also reexports all the stdlib :mod:`subprocess` exceptions and constants for
  convenience. (`#4 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/4>`__)
- You can now create an unbounded :class:`CapacityLimiter` by initializing with
  :obj:`math.inf` (`#618 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/618>`__)
- New :mod:`trio.hazmat` features to allow cleanly switching live coroutine
  objects between Trio and other coroutine runners. Frankly, we're not even
  sure this is a good idea, but we want to `try it out in trio-asyncio
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio-asyncio/issues/42>`__, so here we are.
  For details see :ref:`live-coroutine-handoff`. (`#649
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/649>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a race condition on macOS, where Trio's TCP listener would crash if an
  incoming TCP connection was closed before the listener had a chance to accept
  it. (`#609 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/609>`__)
- :func:`trio.open_tcp_stream()` has been refactored to clean up unsuccessful
  connection attempts more reliably. (`#809
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/809>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove the APIs deprecated in 0.5.0. (``ClosedStreamError``,
  ``ClosedListenerError``, ``Result``) (`#812
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/812>`__)


Miscellaneous internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There are a number of methods on :class:`trio.ssl.SSLStream <trio.SSLStream>`
  that report information about the negotiated TLS connection, like
  ``selected_alpn_protocol``, and thus cannot succeed until after the handshake
  has been performed. Previously, we returned None from these methods, like the
  stdlib :mod:`ssl` module does, but this is confusing, because that can also
  be a valid return value. Now we raise :exc:`trio.ssl.NeedHandshakeError
  <trio.NeedHandshakeError>`
  instead. (`#735 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/735>`__)


Trio 0.9.0 (2018-10-12)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- New and improved APIs for inter-task communication:
  :class:`trio.abc.SendChannel`, :class:`trio.abc.ReceiveChannel`, and
  :func:`trio.open_memory_channel` (which replaces ``trio.Queue``). This
  interface uses separate "sender" and "receiver" objects, for
  consistency with other communication interfaces like
  :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`. Also, the two objects can now be closed
  individually, making it much easier to gracefully shut down a channel.
  Also, check out the nifty ``clone`` API to make it easy to manage
  shutdown in multiple-producer/multiple-consumer scenarios. Also, the
  API has been written to allow for future channel implementations that
  send objects across process boundaries. Also, it supports unbounded
  buffering if you really need it. Also, help I can't stop writing also.
  See :ref:`channels` for more details. (`#497
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/497>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``trio.Queue`` and ``trio.hazmat.UnboundedQueue`` have been deprecated, in
  favor of :func:`trio.open_memory_channel`. (`#497
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/497>`__)


Trio 0.8.0 (2018-10-01)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Trio's default internal clock is now based on :func:`time.perf_counter`
  instead of :func:`time.monotonic`. This makes time-keeping more precise on
  Windows, and has no effect on other platforms. (`#33
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/33>`__)
- Reworked :mod:`trio`, :mod:`trio.testing`, and :mod:`trio.socket` namespace
  construction, making them more understandable by static analysis tools. This
  should improve tab completion in editors, reduce false positives from pylint,
  and is a first step towards providing type hints. (`#542
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/542>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ResourceBusyError`` is now a deprecated alias for the new
  :exc:`BusyResourceError`, and ``BrokenStreamError`` is a deprecated alias for
  the new :exc:`BrokenResourceError`. (`#620
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/620>`__)


Trio 0.7.0 (2018-09-03)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- The length of typical exception traces coming from Trio has been
  greatly reduced. This was done by eliminating many of the exception
  frames related to details of the implementation. For examples, see
  the `blog post
  <https://vorpus.org/blog/beautiful-tracebacks-in-trio-v070/>`__.
  (`#56 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/56>`__)
- New and improved signal catching API: :func:`open_signal_receiver`. (`#354
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/354>`__)
- The low level :func:`trio.hazmat.wait_socket_readable`,
  :func:`~trio.hazmat.wait_socket_writable`, and
  :func:`~trio.hazmat.notify_socket_close` now work on bare socket descriptors,
  instead of requiring a :func:`socket.socket` object. (`#400
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/400>`__)
- If you're using :func:`trio.hazmat.wait_task_rescheduled` and other low-level
  routines to implement a new sleeping primitive, you can now use the new
  :data:`trio.hazmat.Task.custom_sleep_data` attribute to pass arbitrary data
  between the sleeping task, abort function, and waking task. (`#616
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/616>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Prevent crashes when used with Sentry (raven-python). (`#599
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/599>`__)
- The nursery context manager was rewritten to avoid use of
  `@asynccontextmanager` and `@async_generator`. This reduces extraneous frames
  in exception traces and addresses bugs regarding `StopIteration` and
  `StopAsyncIteration` exceptions not propagating correctly. (`#612
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/612>`__)
- Updates the formatting of exception messages raised by
  :func:`trio.open_tcp_stream` to correctly handle a hostname passed in as
  bytes, by converting the hostname to a string. (`#633
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/633>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``trio.catch_signals`` has been deprecated in favor of
  :func:`open_signal_receiver`. The main differences are: it takes
  \*-args now to specify the list of signals (so
  ``open_signal_receiver(SIGINT)`` instead of
  ``catch_signals({SIGINT})``), and, the async iterator now yields
  individual signals, instead of "batches" (`#354
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/354>`__)
- Remove all the APIs deprecated in 0.3.0 and 0.4.0. (`#623
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/623>`__)


Trio 0.6.0 (2018-08-13)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add :func:`trio.hazmat.WaitForSingleObject` async function to await Windows
  handles. (`#233 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/233>`__)
- The `sniffio <https://github.com/python-trio/sniffio>`__ library can now
  detect when Trio is running. (`#572
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/572>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Make trio.socket._SocketType.connect *always* close the socket on
  cancellation (`#247 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/247>`__)
- Fix a memory leak in :class:`trio.CapacityLimiter`, that could occurr when
  ``acquire`` or ``acquire_on_behalf_of`` was cancelled. (`#548
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/548>`__)
- Some version of macOS have a buggy ``getaddrinfo`` that was causing spurious
  test failures; we now detect those systems and skip the relevant test when
  found. (`#580 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/580>`__)
- Prevent crashes when used with Sentry (raven-python). (`#599
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/599>`__)


Trio 0.5.0 (2018-07-20)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Suppose one task is blocked trying to use a resource – for example, reading
  from a socket – and while it's doing this, another task closes the resource.
  Previously, this produced undefined behavior. Now, closing a resource causes
  pending operations on that resource to terminate immediately with a
  :exc:`ClosedResourceError`. ``ClosedStreamError`` and ``ClosedListenerError``
  are now aliases for :exc:`ClosedResourceError`, and deprecated. For this to
  work, Trio needs to know when a resource has been closed. To facilitate this,
  new functions have been added: :func:`trio.hazmat.notify_fd_close` and
  :func:`trio.hazmat.notify_socket_close`. If you're using Trio's built-in
  wrappers like :class:`~trio.SocketStream` or :mod:`trio.socket`, then you don't
  need to worry about this, but if you're using the low-level functions like
  :func:`trio.hazmat.wait_readable`, you should make sure to call these
  functions at appropriate times. (`#36
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/36>`__)
- Tasks created by :func:`~trio.hazmat.spawn_system_task` now no longer inherit
  the creator's :mod:`contextvars` context, instead using one created at
  :func:`~trio.run`. (`#289
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/289>`__)
- Add support for ``trio.Queue`` with ``capacity=0``. Queue's implementation
  is also faster now. (`#473
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/473>`__)
- Switch to using standalone `Outcome
  <https://github.com/python-trio/outcome>`__ library for Result objects.
  (`#494 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/494>`__)

Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``trio.hazmat.Result``, ``trio.hazmat.Value`` and
  ``trio.hazmat.Error`` have been replaced by the equivalent
  classes in the `Outcome <https://github.com/python-trio/outcome>`__ library.

Trio 0.4.0 (2018-04-10)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add unix client socket support. (`#401
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/401>`__)
- Add support for :mod:`contextvars` (see :ref:`task-local storage
  <task-local-storage>`), and add :class:`trio.hazmat.RunVar` as a similar API
  for run-local variables. Deprecate ``trio.TaskLocal`` and
  ``trio.hazmat.RunLocal`` in favor of these new APIs. (`#420
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/420>`__)
- Add :func:`trio.hazmat.current_root_task` to get the root task. (`#452
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/452>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fix KeyboardInterrupt handling when threading state has been modified by a
  3rd-party library. (`#461
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/461>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Attempting to explicitly raise :exc:`trio.Cancelled` will cause a :exc:`RuntimeError`.
  :meth:`cancel_scope.cancel() <trio.The cancel scope interface.cancel>` should
  be used instead. (`#342 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/342>`__)


Miscellaneous internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Simplify implementation of primitive traps like :func:`~trio.hazmat.wait_task_rescheduled`
  (`#395 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/395>`__)


Trio 0.3.0 (2017-12-28)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- **Simplified nurseries**: In Trio, the rule used to be that "parenting is a
  full time job", meaning that after a task opened a nursery and spawned some
  children into it, it had to immediately block in ``__aexit__`` to supervise
  the new children, or else exception propagation wouldn't work. Also there was
  some elaborate machinery to let you replace this supervision logic with your
  own custom supervision logic. Thanks to new advances in task-rearing
  technology, **parenting is no longer a full time job!** Now the supervision
  happens automatically in the background, and essentially the body of a
  ``async with trio.open_nursery()`` block acts just like a task running inside
  the nursery. This is important: it makes it possible for libraries to
  abstract over nursery creation. For example, if you have a Websocket library
  that needs to run a background task to handle Websocket pings, you can now do
  that with ``async with open_websocket(...) as ws: ...``, and that can run a
  task in the background without your users having to worry about parenting it.
  And don't worry, you can still make custom supervisors; it turned out all
  that spiffy machinery was actually redundant and didn't provide much value.
  (`#136 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/136>`__)
- Trio socket methods like ``bind`` and ``connect`` no longer require
  "pre-resolved" numeric addresses; you can now pass regular hostnames and Trio
  will implicitly resolve them for you. (`#377
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/377>`__)


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed some corner cases in Trio socket method implicit name resolution to
  better match stdlib behavior. Example: ``sock.bind(("", port))`` now binds to
  the wildcard address instead of raising an error. (`#277
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/277>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed everything that was deprecated in 0.2.0; see the 0.2.0
  release notes below for details.
- As was foretold in the v0.2.0 release notes, the ``bind`` method on Trio
  sockets is now async. Please update your calls or – better yet – switch to
  our shiny new high-level networking API, like :func:`serve_tcp`. (`#241
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/241>`__)
- The ``resolve_local_address`` and ``resolve_remote_address`` methods
  on Trio sockets have been deprecated; these are unnecessary now that
  you can just pass your hostnames directly to the socket methods you
  want to use. (`#377
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/377>`__)


Trio 0.2.0 (2017-12-06)
-----------------------

Trio 0.2.0 contains changes from 14 contributors, and brings major new
features and bug fixes, as well as a number of deprecations and a very
small number of backwards incompatible changes. We anticipate that
these should be easy to adapt to, but make sure to read about them
below, and if you're using Trio then remember to `read and subscribe
to issue #1 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1>`__.


Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a comprehensive API for async filesystem I/O: see
  :ref:`async-file-io` (`gh-20
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/20>`__)

* The new nursery :meth:`~The nursery interface.start` method makes it
  easy to perform controlled start-up of long-running tasks. For
  example, given an appropriate ``http_server_on_random_open_port``
  function, you could write::

      port = await nursery.start(http_server_on_random_open_port)

  and this would start the server running in the background in the
  nursery, and then give you back the random port it selected – but
  not until it had finished initializing and was ready to accept
  requests!

* Added a :ref:`new abstract API for byte streams
  <abstract-stream-api>`, and :mod:`trio.testing` gained helpers for
  creating fake streams for :ref:`testing your protocol implementation
  <virtual-streams>` and checking that your custom stream
  implementation :ref:`follows the stream contract
  <testing-custom-streams>`.

* If you're currently using :mod:`trio.socket` then you should
  :ref:`switch to using our new high-level networking API instead
  <high-level-networking>`. It takes care of many tiresome details, it's
  fully integrated with the abstract stream API, and it provides
  niceties like a state-of-the-art `Happy Eyeballs implementation
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs>`__ in
  :func:`open_tcp_stream` and server helpers that integrate with
  ``nursery.start``.

* We've also added comprehensive support for SSL/TLS encryption,
  including SNI (both client and server side), STARTTLS, renegotiation
  during full-duplex usage (subject to OpenSSL limitations), and
  applying encryption to arbitrary :class:`~trio.abc.Stream`\s, which
  allows for interesting applications like `TLS-over-TLS
  <https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/11/26/https-proxy-with-curl/>`__.
  See: :func:`trio.open_ssl_over_tcp_stream`,
  :func:`trio.serve_ssl_over_tcp`,
  :func:`trio.open_ssl_over_tcp_listeners`, and ``trio.ssl``.

  Interesting fact: the test suite for ``trio.ssl`` has so far
  found bugs in CPython's ssl module, PyPy's ssl module, PyOpenSSL,
  and OpenSSL. (``trio.ssl`` doesn't use PyOpenSSL.) Trio's test
  suite is fairly thorough.

* You know thread-local storage? Well, Trio now has an equivalent:
  :ref:`task-local storage <task-local-storage>`. There's also the
  related, but more obscure, run-local storage; see
  :class:`~trio.hazmat.RunLocal`. (`#2
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/2>`__)

* Added a new :ref:`guide to for contributors <contributing>`.


Breaking changes and deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trio is a young and ambitious project, but it also aims to become a
stable, production-quality foundation for async I/O in Python.
Therefore, our approach for now is to provide deprecation warnings
where-ever possible, but on a fairly aggressive cycle as we push
towards stability. If you use Trio you should `read and subscribe to
issue #1 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1>`__. We'd also
welcome feedback on how this approach is working, whether our
deprecation warnings could be more helpful, or anything else.

The tl;dr is: stop using ``socket.bind`` if you can, and then fix
everything your test suite warns you about.

Upcoming breaking changes without warnings (i.e., stuff that works in
0.2.0, but won't work in 0.3.0):

* In the next release, the ``bind`` method on Trio socket objects will
  become async (`#241
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/241>`__). Unfortunately,
  there's no good way to provide a warning here. We recommend
  switching to the new highlevel networking APIs like
  :func:`serve_tcp`, which will insulate you from this change.

Breaking changes (i.e., stuff that could theoretically break a program
that worked on 0.1.0):

* :mod:`trio.socket` no longer attempts to normalize or modernize
  socket options across different platforms. The high-level networking
  API now handles that, freeing :mod:`trio.socket` to focus on giving
  you raw, unadulterated BSD sockets.

* When a socket ``sendall`` call was cancelled, it used to attach some
  metadata to the exception reporting how much data was actually sent.
  It no longer does this, because in common configurations like an
  :class:`~trio.SSLStream` wrapped around a
  :class:`~trio.SocketStream` it becomes ambiguous which "level" the
  partial metadata applies to, leading to confusion and bugs. There is
  no longer any way to tell how much data was sent after a ``sendall``
  is cancelled.

* The :func:`trio.socket.getprotobyname` function is now async, like
  it should have been all along. I doubt anyone will ever use it, but
  that's no reason not to get the details right.

* The :mod:`trio.socket` functions ``getservbyport``,
  ``getservbyname``, and ``getfqdn`` have been removed, because they
  were obscure, buggy, and obsolete. Use
  :func:`~trio.socket.getaddrinfo` instead.

Upcoming breaking changes with warnings (i.e., stuff that in 0.2.0
*will* work but will print loud complaints, and that won't work in
0.3.0):

* For consistency with the new ``start`` method, the nursery ``spawn``
  method is being renamed to ``start_soon`` (`#284
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/284>`__)

* ``trio.socket.sendall`` is deprecated; use ``trio.open_tcp_stream``
  and ``SocketStream.send_all`` instead (`#291
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/291>`__)

* Trio now consistently uses ``run`` for functions that take and run
  an async function (like :func:`trio.run`!), and ``run_sync`` for
  functions that take and run a synchronous function. As part of this:

  * ``run_in_worker_thread`` is becoming
    :func:`run_sync_in_worker_thread`

  * We took the opportunity to refactor ``run_in_trio_thread`` and
    ``await_in_trio_thread`` into the new class
    :class:`trio.BlockingTrioPortal`

  * The hazmat function ``current_call_soon_thread_and_signal_safe``
    is being replaced by :class:`trio.hazmat.TrioToken`

  See `#68 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/68>`__ for
  details.

* ``trio.Queue``\'s ``join`` and ``task_done`` methods are
  deprecated without replacement (`#321
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/321>`__)

* Trio 0.1.0 provided a set of built-in mechanisms for waiting for and
  tracking the result of individual tasks. We haven't yet found any
  cases where using this actually led to simpler code, though, and
  this feature is blocking useful improvements, so the following are
  being deprecated without replacement:

  * ``nursery.zombies``
  * ``nursery.monitor``
  * ``nursery.reap``
  * ``nursery.reap_and_unwrap``
  * ``task.result``
  * ``task.add_monitor``
  * ``task.discard_monitor``
  * ``task.wait``

  This also lets us move a number of lower-level features out of the
  main :mod:`trio` namespace and into :mod:`trio.hazmat`:

  * ``trio.Task`` → :class:`trio.hazmat.Task`
  * ``trio.current_task`` → :func:`trio.hazmat.current_task`
  * ``trio.Result`` → ``trio.hazmat.Result``
  * ``trio.Value`` → ``trio.hazmat.Value``
  * ``trio.Error`` → ``trio.hazmat.Error``
  * ``trio.UnboundedQueue`` → ``trio.hazmat.UnboundedQueue``

  In addition, several introspection attributes are being renamed:

  * ``nursery.children`` → ``nursery.child_tasks``
  * ``task.parent_task`` → use ``task.parent_nursery.parent_task`` instead

  See `#136 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/136>`__ for
  more details.

* To consolidate introspection functionality in :mod:`trio.hazmat`,
  the following functions are moving:

  * ``trio.current_clock`` → :func:`trio.hazmat.current_clock`
  * ``trio.current_statistics`` → :func:`trio.hazmat.current_statistics`

  See `#317 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/317>`__ for
  more details.

* It was decided that 0.1.0's "yield point" terminology was confusing;
  we now use :ref:`"checkpoint" <checkpoints>` instead. As part of
  this, the following functions in :mod:`trio.hazmat` are changing
  names:

  * ``yield_briefly`` → :func:`~trio.hazmat.checkpoint`
  * ``yield_briefly_no_cancel`` → :func:`~trio.hazmat.cancel_shielded_checkpoint`
  * ``yield_if_cancelled`` → :func:`~trio.hazmat.checkpoint_if_cancelled`
  * ``yield_indefinitely`` → :func:`~trio.hazmat.wait_task_rescheduled`

  In addition, the following functions in :mod:`trio.testing` are
  changing names:

  * ``assert_yields`` → :func:`~trio.testing.assert_checkpoints`
  * ``assert_no_yields`` → :func:`~trio.testing.assert_no_checkpoints`

  See `#157 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/157>`__ for
  more details.

* ``trio.format_exception`` is deprecated; use
  :func:`traceback.format_exception` instead (`#347
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/347>`__).

* ``trio.current_instruments`` is deprecated. For adding or removing
  instrumentation at run-time, see :func:`trio.hazmat.add_instrument`
  and :func:`trio.hazmat.remove_instrument` (`#257
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/257>`__)

Unfortunately, a limitation in PyPy3 5.8 breaks our deprecation
handling for some renames. (Attempting to use the old names will give
an unhelpful error instead of a helpful warning.) This does not affect
CPython, or PyPy3 5.9+.


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :func:`run_sync_in_worker_thread` now has a :ref:`robust mechanism
  for applying capacity limits to the number of concurrent threads
  <worker-thread-limiting>` (`#10
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/170>`__, `#57
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/57>`__, `#156
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/156>`__)

* New support for tests to cleanly hook hostname lookup and socket
  operations: see :ref:`virtual-network-hooks`. In addition,
  ``trio.socket.SocketType`` is now an empty abstract base class, with
  the actual socket class made private. This shouldn't effect anyone,
  since the only thing you could directly use it for in the first
  place was ``isinstance`` checks, and those still work (`#170
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/170>`__)

* New class :class:`StrictFIFOLock`

* New exception ``ResourceBusyError``

* The :class:`trio.hazmat.ParkingLot` class (which is used to
  implement many of Trio's synchronization primitives) was rewritten
  to be simpler and faster (`#272
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/272>`__, `#287
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/287>`__)

* It's generally true that if you're using Trio you have to use Trio
  functions, if you're using asyncio you have to use asyncio
  functions, and so forth. (See the discussion of the "async sandwich"
  in the Trio tutorial for more details.) So for example, this isn't
  going to work::

      async def main():
          # asyncio here
          await asyncio.sleep(1)

      # trio here
      trio.run(main)

  Trio now reliably detects if you accidentally do something like
  this, and gives a helpful error message.

* Trio now also has special error messages for several other common
  errors, like doing ``trio.run(some_func())`` (should be
  ``trio.run(some_func)``).

* :mod:`trio.socket` now handles non-ascii domain names using the
  modern IDNA 2008 standard instead of the obsolete IDNA 2003 standard
  (`#11 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/11>`__)

* When an :class:`~trio.abc.Instrument` raises an unexpected error, we
  now route it through the :mod:`logging` module instead of printing
  it directly to stderr. Normally this produces exactly the same
  effect, but this way it's more configurable. (`#306
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/306>`__)

* Fixed a minor race condition in IOCP thread shutdown on Windows
  (`#81 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/81>`__)

* Control-C handling on Windows now uses :func:`signal.set_wakeup_fd`
  and should be more reliable (`#42
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/42>`__)

* :func:`trio.run` takes a new keyword argument
  ``restrict_keyboard_interrupt_to_checkpoints``

* New attributes allow more detailed introspection of the task tree:
  ``nursery.child_tasks``, ``Task.child_nurseries``,
  ``nursery.parent_task``, ``Task.parent_nursery``

* :func:`trio.testing.wait_all_tasks_blocked` now takes a
  ``tiebreaker=`` argument. The main use is to allow
  :class:`~trio.testing.MockClock`\'s auto-jump functionality to avoid
  interfering with direct use of
  :func:`~trio.testing.wait_all_tasks_blocked` in the same test.

* :meth:`MultiError.catch` now correctly preserves ``__context__``,
  despite Python's best attempts to stop us (`#165
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/165>`__)

* It is now possible to take weakrefs to :class:`Lock` and many other
  classes (`#331 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/331>`__)

* Fix ``sock.accept()`` for IPv6 sockets (`#164
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/164>`__)

* PyCharm (and hopefully other IDEs) can now offer better completions
  for the :mod:`trio` and :mod:`trio.hazmat` modules (`#314
  <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/314>`__)

* Trio now uses `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__ to
  standardize formatting across the source tree, so we never have to
  think about whitespace again.

* Many documentation improvements


Trio 0.1.0 (2017-03-10)

* Initial release.

    # these signals are only delivered if/when you access the console? I
    # don't really know what was going on there. From reading the
    # GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent docs I don't know how it worked at all.
    #
    # I later spent a bunch of time trying to make GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent
    # work for creating synthetic control-C events, and... failed

class Sequencer:
    """A convenience class for forcing code in different tasks to run in an
    explicit linear order.

    Instances of this class implement a ``__call__`` method which returns an
    async context manager. The idea is that you pass a sequence number to
    ``__call__`` to say where this block of code should go in the linear
    sequence. Block 0 starts immediately, and then block N doesn't start until
    block N-1 has finished.

    Example:
      An extremely elaborate way to print the numbers 0-5, in order::

         async def worker1(seq):
             async with seq(0):
                 print(0)
             async with seq(4):
                 print(4)

         async def worker2(seq):
             async with seq(2):
                 print(2)
             async with seq(5):
                 print(5)

         async def worker3(seq):
             async with seq(1):
                 print(1)
             async with seq(3):
                 print(3)

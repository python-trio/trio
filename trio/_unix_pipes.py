    # responsible for making sure it gets closed, and also for tracking
    # whether it's been closed.
    #
    # The way we track closure is to set the .fd field to -1, discarding the
    # original value. You might think that this is a strange idea, since it
    # overloads the same field to do two different things. Wouldn't it be more
    # natural to have a dedicated .closed field? But that would be more
    # error-prone. Fds are represented by small integers, and once an fd is
    # closed, its integer value may be reused immediately. If we accidentally
    # used the old fd after being closed, we might end up doing something to
    # another unrelated fd that happened to get assigned the same integer
    # value. By throwing away the integer value immediately, it becomes
    # impossible to make this mistake â€“ we'll just get an EBADF.

    # 1.5 is an arbitrary fudge factor because there's always some delay
    # between when we become eligible to wake up and when we actually do. We
    # used to sleep for 0.05, and regularly observed overruns of 1.6x on
    # Appveyor, and then started seeing overruns of 2.3x on Travis's macOS, so
    # now we bumped up the sleep to 1 second, marked the tests as slow, and
    # hopefully now the proportional error will be less huge.
    #
    # We also also for durations that are a hair shorter than expected. For
    # example, here's a run on Windows where a 1.0 second sleep was measured
    # to take 0.9999999999999858 seconds:
    #   https://ci.appveyor.com/project/njsmith/trio/build/1.0.768/job/3lbdyxl63q3h9s21
    # I believe that what happened here is that Windows's low clock resolution
    # meant that our calls to time.monotonic() returned exactly the same
    # values as the calls inside the actual run loop, but the two subtractions
    # returned slightly different values because the run loop's clock adds a
    # random floating point offset to both times, which should cancel out, but
    # lol floating point we got slightly different rounding errors. (That
    # value above is exactly 128 ULPs below 1.0, which would make sense if it
    # started as a 1 ULP error at a different dynamic range.)

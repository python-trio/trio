    # I think the only fix is to wait for fixed CPython to be released, so in
    # the mean time, on affected versions we send two signals (equivalent to
    # hitting control-C twice). This works because the problem is that the C
    # level signal handler does
    #
    #   write-to-fd -> set-flags
    #
    # and we need
    #
    #   set-flags -> write-to-fd
    #
    # so running the C level signal handler twice does
    #
    #   write-to-fd -> set-flags -> write-to-fd -> set-flags
    #
    # which contains the desired sequence.
    #
    # Affected version of CPython include 3.6.1 and earlier.
    # It's fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.7+
    #

    # delivered to a non-main thread, though we haven't observed this in

          crash.

        * System tasks are automatically cancelled when the main task exits.

        * By default, system tasks have :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` protection
          *enabled*. If you want your task to be interruptible by control-C,

           trio task. This is safe to call from the main thread, from other
           threads, and from signal handlers.

           The call is effectively run as part of a system task (see
           :func:`~trio.hazmat.spawn_system_task`). In particular this means

           * If ``sync_fn`` raises an exception, then it's converted into a
             :exc:`~trio.TrioInternalError` and *all* tasks are cancelled. You
             should be careful that ``sync_fn`` doesn't crash.

           All calls with ``idempotent=False`` are processed in strict
           first-in first-out order.

           If ``idempotent=True``, then ``sync_fn`` and ``args`` must be
           hashable, and trio will make a best-effort attempt to discard any
           call submission which is equal to an already-pending call. Trio
           will make an attempt to process these in first-in first-out order,
           but no guarantees. (Currently processing is FIFO on CPython 3.6 and
           PyPy, but not CPython 3.5.)

           Any ordering guarantees apply separately to ``idempotent=False``
           and ``idempotent=True`` calls; there's no rule for how calls in the
           different categories are ordered with respect to each other.

        """Block until there are no runnable tasks.

        This is useful in testing code when you want to give other tasks a
        chance to "settle down". The calling task is blocked, and doesn't wake
        up until all other tasks are also blocked for at least ``cushion``
        seconds. (Setting a non-zero ``cushion`` is intended to handle cases
        like two tasks talking to each other over a local socket, where we
        want to ignore the potential brief moment between a send and receive
        when all tasks are blocked.)

        Note that ``cushion`` is measured in *real* time, not the trio clock
        time.

        If there are multiple tasks blocked in :func:`wait_all_tasks_blocked`,
        then the one with the shortest ``cushion`` is the one woken (and the
        this task becoming unblocked resets the timers for the remaining
        tasks). If there are multiple tasks that have exactly the same
        ``cushion``, then the one with the lowest ``tiebreaker`` value is
        woken first. And if there are multiple tasks with the same ``cushion``
        and the same ``tiebreaker``, then all are woken.

        You should also consider :class:`trio.testing.Sequencer`, which
        provides a more explicit way to control execution ordering within a
        test, and will often produce more readable tests.

        Example:
          Here's an example of one way to test that trio's locks are fair: we
          take the lock in the parent, spawn a child, wait for the child to be
          blocked waiting for the lock (!), and then check that we can't
          release and immediately re-acquire the lock::

    """Run a trio-flavored async function, and return the result.

    Calling::

       run(async_fn, *args)

    is the equivalent of::

       await async_fn(*args)

    except that :func:`run` can (and must) be called from a synchronous
    context.

    This is trio's main entry point. Almost every other function in trio
    requires that you be inside a call to :func:`run`.

    Args:
      async_fn: An async function.

      args: Positional arguments to be passed to *async_fn*. If you need to
          pass keyword arguments, then use :func:`functools.partial`.

      clock: ``None`` to use the default system-specific monotonic clock;
          otherwise, an object implementing the :class:`trio.abc.Clock`
          interface, like (for example) a :class:`trio.testing.MockClock`
          instance.

      instruments (list of :class:`trio.abc.Instrument` objects): Any
          instrumentation you want to apply to this run. This can also be
          modified during the run; see :ref:`instrumentation`.

      restrict_keyboard_interrupt_to_checkpoints (bool): What happens if the
          user hits control-C while :func:`run` is running? If this argument
          is False (the default), then you get the standard Python behavior: a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception will immediately interrupt
          whatever task is running (or if no task is running, then trio will
          wake up a task to be interrupted). Alternatively, if you set this
          argument to True, then :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` delivery will be
          delayed: it will be *only* be raised at :ref:`checkpoints
          <checkpoints>`, like a :exc:`Cancelled` exception.

          The default behavior is nice because it means that even if you
          accidentally write an infinite loop that never executes any
          checkpoints, then you can still break out of it using control-C. The
          the alternative behavior is nice if you're paranoid about a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at just the wrong place leaving your
          program in an inconsistent state, because it means that you only
          have to worry about :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at the exact same
          places where you already have to worry about :exc:`Cancelled`.

          This setting has no effect if your program has registered a custom
          SIGINT handler, or if :func:`run` is called from anywhere but the
          main thread (this is a Python limitation), or if you use
          :func:`catch_signals` to catch SIGINT.

    Returns:
      Whatever ``async_fn`` returns.

    Raises:
      TrioInternalError: if an unexpected error is encountered inside trio's
          internal machinery. This is a bug and you should `let us know
          <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues>`__.

      Anything else: if ``async_fn`` raises an exception, then :func:`run`
          propagates it.

    """Returns the current effective deadline for the current task.

    This function examines all the cancellation scopes that are currently in
    effect (taking into account shielding), and returns the deadline that will
    expire first.

    One example of where this might be is useful is if your code is trying to
    decide whether to begin an expensive operation like an RPC call, but wants
    to skip it if it knows that it can't possibly complete in the available
    time. Another example would be if you're using a protocol like gRPC that
    `propagates timeout information to the remote peer
    <http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#deadlines>`__; this function
    gives a way to fetch that information so you can send it along.

    If this is called in a context where a cancellation is currently active
    (i.e., a blocking call will immediately raise :exc:`Cancelled`), then
    returned deadline is ``-inf``. If it is called in a context where no
    scopes have a deadline set, it returns ``inf``.

    Returns:
        float: the effective deadline, as an absolute time.

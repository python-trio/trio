    of code that will become cancelled, or not, as a unit.

    Each task has at all times a single "active" CancelStatus whose
    cancellation state determines whether checkpoints executed in that
    task raise Cancelled. Each 'with CancelScope(...)' context is
    associated with a particular CancelStatus.  When a task enters
    such a context, a CancelStatus is created which becomes the active
    CancelStatus for that task; when the 'with' block is exited, the
    active CancelStatus for that task goes back to whatever it was
    before.

    CancelStatus objects are arranged in a tree whose structure
    mirrors the lexical nesting of the cancel scope contexts.  When a
    CancelStatus becomes cancelled, it notifies all of its direct
    children, who become cancelled in turn (and continue propagating
    the cancellation down the tree) unless they are shielded. (There
    will be at most one such child except in the case of a
    CancelStatus that immediately encloses a nursery.) At the leaves
    of this tree are the tasks themselves, which get woken up to deliver
    an abort when their direct parent CancelStatus becomes cancelled.

    You can think of CancelStatus as being responsible for the
    "plumbing" of cancellations as oppposed to CancelScope which is
    responsible for the origination of them.

This is probably a bug in your code, that has caused Trio's internal state to
become corrupted. We'll do our best to recover, but from now on there are
no guarantees.

Typically this is caused by one of the following:
  - yielding within a generator or async generator that's opened a cancel
    scope or nursery (unless the generator is a @contextmanager or
    @asynccontextmanager); see https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/638
  - manually calling __enter__ or __exit__ on a trio.CancelScope, or
    __aenter__ or __aexit__ on the object returned by trio.open_nursery();
    doing so correctly is difficult and you should use @[async]contextmanager
    instead, or maybe [Async]ExitStack
  - using [Async]ExitStack to interleave the entries/exits of cancel scopes
    and/or nurseries in a way that couldn't be achieved by some nesting of
    'with' and 'async with' blocks
  - using the low-level coroutine object protocol to execute some parts of
    an async function in a different cancel scope/nursery context than
    other parts
If you don't believe you're doing any of these things, please file a bug:

    """A *cancellation scope*: the link between a unit of cancellable
    work and Trio's cancellation system.

    A :class:`CancelScope` becomes associated with some cancellable work
    when it is used as a context manager surrounding that work::

        cancel_scope = trio.CancelScope()
        ...
        with cancel_scope:
            await long_running_operation()

    Inside the ``with`` block, a cancellation of ``cancel_scope`` (via
    a call to its :meth:`cancel` method or via the expiry of its
    :attr:`deadline`) will immediately interrupt the
    ``long_running_operation()`` by raising :exc:`Cancelled` at its
    next :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoints>`.

    The context manager ``__enter__`` returns the :class:`CancelScope`
    object itself, so you can also write ``with trio.CancelScope() as
    cancel_scope:``.

    If a cancel scope becomes cancelled before entering its ``with`` block,
    the :exc:`Cancelled` exception will be raised at the first
    checkpoint inside the ``with`` block. This allows a
    :class:`CancelScope` to be created in one :ref:`task <tasks>` and
    passed to another, so that the first task can later cancel some work
    inside the second.

    Cancel scopes are not reusable or reentrant; that is, each cancel
    scope can be used for at most one ``with`` block.  (You'll get a
    :exc:`RuntimeError` if you violate this rule.)

    The :class:`CancelScope` constructor takes initial values for the
    cancel scope's :attr:`deadline` and :attr:`shield` attributes; these
    may be freely modified after construction, whether or not the scope
    has been entered yet, and changes take immediate effect.

        This and :meth:`start` are the two fundamental methods for
        creating concurrent tasks in Trio.

        Note that this is *not* an async function and you don't use await
        when calling it. It sets up the new task, but then returns
        immediately, *before* it has a chance to run. The new task won’t
        actually get a chance to do anything until some later point when
        you execute a checkpoint and the scheduler decides to run it.
        If you want to run a function and immediately wait for its result,
        then you don't need a nursery; just use ``await async_fn(*args)``.
        If you want to wait for the task to initialize itself before
        continuing, see :meth:`start()`.

        It's possible to pass a nursery object into another task, which
        allows that task to start new child tasks in the first task's
        nursery.

        The child task inherits its parent nursery's cancel scopes.

        Args:
            async_fn: An async callable.
            args: Positional arguments for ``async_fn``. If you want
                  to pass keyword arguments, use
                  :func:`functools.partial`.
            name: The name for this task. Only used for
                  debugging/introspection
                  (e.g. ``repr(task_obj)``). If this isn't a string,
                  :meth:`start_soon` will try to make it one. A
                  common use case is if you're wrapping a function
                  before spawning a new task, you might pass the
                  original function as the ``name=`` to make
                  debugging easier.

        Returns:
            True if successful, False otherwise.

            RuntimeError: If this nursery is no longer open
                          (i.e. its ``async with`` block has

        Like :meth:`start_soon`, but blocks until the new task has
        finished initializing itself, and optionally returns some
        information from it.

        The ``async_fn`` must accept a ``task_status`` keyword argument,
        and it must make sure that it (or someone) eventually calls
        ``task_status.started()``.

        The conventional way to define ``async_fn`` is like::

            async def async_fn(arg1, arg2, \*, task_status=trio.TASK_STATUS_IGNORED):
                ...
                task_status.started()
                ...

        :attr:`trio.TASK_STATUS_IGNORED` is a special global object with
        a do-nothing ``started`` method. This way your function supports
        being called either like ``await nursery.start(async_fn, arg1,
        arg2)`` or directly like ``await async_fn(arg1, arg2)``, and
        either way it can call ``task_status.started()`` without
        worrying about which mode it's in. Defining your function like
        this will make it obvious to readers that it supports being used
        in both modes.

        Before the child calls ``task_status.started()``, it's
        effectively run underneath the call to :meth:`start`: if it
        raises an exception then that exception is reported by
        :meth:`start`, and does *not* propagate out of the nursery. If
        :meth:`start` is cancelled, then the child task is also
        cancelled.

        When the child calls ``task_status.started()``, it's moved out
        from underneath :meth:`start` and into the given nursery.

        If the child task passes a value to
        ``task_status.started(value)``, then :meth:`start` returns this
        value. Otherwise it returns ``None``.

        System tasks have a few differences from regular tasks:

        * They don't need an explicit nursery; instead they go into the
          internal "system nursery".

        * If a system task raises an exception, then it's converted into a
          :exc:`~trio.TrioInternalError` and *all* tasks are cancelled. If you
          write a system task, you should be careful to make sure it doesn't
          crash.

        * System tasks are automatically cancelled when the main task exits.

        * By default, system tasks have :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` forbidden.
          If you want (part of) your task to be interruptible by control-C,
          then you need to wrap it in :func:`ki_allowed_if_safe` (and
          come up with some plan for what to do with a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`, given that system tasks aren't allowed to
          raise exceptions).

        * System tasks do not inherit context variables from their creator.

        """Block until there are no runnable tasks.

        This is useful in testing code when you want to give other tasks a
        chance to "settle down". The calling task is blocked, and doesn't wake
        up until all other tasks are also blocked for at least ``cushion``
        seconds. (Setting a non-zero ``cushion`` is intended to handle cases
        like two tasks talking to each other over a local socket, where we
        want to ignore the potential brief moment between a send and receive
        when all tasks are blocked.)

        Note that ``cushion`` is measured in *real* time, not the Trio clock
        time.

        If there are multiple tasks blocked in :func:`wait_all_tasks_blocked`,
        then the one with the shortest ``cushion`` is the one woken (and
        this task becoming unblocked resets the timers for the remaining
        tasks). If there are multiple tasks that have exactly the same
        ``cushion``, then the one with the lowest ``tiebreaker`` value is
        woken first. And if there are multiple tasks with the same ``cushion``
        and the same ``tiebreaker``, then all are woken.

        You should also consider :class:`trio.testing.Sequencer`, which
        provides a more explicit way to control execution ordering within a
        test, and will often produce more readable tests.

        Example:
          Here's an example of one way to test that Trio's locks are fair: we
          take the lock in the parent, start a child, wait for the child to be
          blocked waiting for the lock (!), and then check that we can't
          release and immediately re-acquire the lock::

             async def lock_taker(lock):
                 await lock.acquire()

                     # child hasn't run yet, we have the lock
                     assert lock.locked()
                     assert lock._owner is trio.lowlevel.current_task()

def run(

    clock=None,

):
    """Run a Trio-flavored async function, and return the result.

    Calling::

       run(async_fn, *args)

    is the equivalent of::

       await async_fn(*args)

    except that :func:`run` can (and must) be called from a synchronous
    context.

    This is Trio's main entry point. Almost every other function in Trio
    requires that you be inside a call to :func:`run`.

    Args:
      async_fn: An async function.

      args: Positional arguments to be passed to *async_fn*. If you need to
          pass keyword arguments, then use :func:`functools.partial`.

      clock: ``None`` to use the default system-specific monotonic clock;
          otherwise, an object implementing the :class:`trio.abc.Clock`
          interface, like (for example) a :class:`trio.testing.MockClock`
          instance.

      instruments (list of :class:`trio.abc.Instrument` objects): Any
          instrumentation you want to apply to this run. This can also be
          modified during the run; see :ref:`instrumentation`.

      restrict_keyboard_interrupt_to_checkpoints (bool): What happens if the
          user hits control-C while :func:`run` is running? If this argument
          is False (the default), then you get the standard Python behavior: a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception will immediately interrupt
          whatever task is running (or if no task is running, then Trio will
          wake up a task to be interrupted). Alternatively, if you set this
          argument to True, then :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` delivery will be
          delayed: it will be *only* be raised at :ref:`checkpoints
          <checkpoints>`, like a :exc:`Cancelled` exception.

          The default behavior is nice because it means that even if you
          accidentally write an infinite loop that never executes any
          checkpoints, then you can still break out of it using control-C.
          The alternative behavior is nice if you're paranoid about a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at just the wrong place leaving your
          program in an inconsistent state, because it means that you only
          have to worry about :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` at the exact same
          places where you already have to worry about :exc:`Cancelled`.

          This setting has no effect if your program has registered a custom
          SIGINT handler, or if :func:`run` is called from anywhere but the
          main thread (this is a Python limitation), or if you use
          :func:`open_signal_receiver` to catch SIGINT.

    Returns:
      Whatever ``async_fn`` returns.

    Raises:
      TrioInternalError: if an unexpected error is encountered inside Trio's
          internal machinery. This is a bug and you should `let us know
          <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues>`__.

      Anything else: if ``async_fn`` raises an exception, then :func:`run`
          propagates it.

    """Returns the current effective deadline for the current task.

    This function examines all the cancellation scopes that are currently in
    effect (taking into account shielding), and returns the deadline that will
    expire first.

    One example of where this might be is useful is if your code is trying to
    decide whether to begin an expensive operation like an RPC call, but wants
    to skip it if it knows that it can't possibly complete in the available
    time. Another example would be if you're using a protocol like gRPC that
    `propagates timeout information to the remote peer
    <http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#deadlines>`__; this function
    gives a way to fetch that information so you can send it along.

    If this is called in a context where a cancellation is currently active
    (i.e., a blocking call will immediately raise :exc:`Cancelled`), then
    returned deadline is ``-inf``. If it is called in a context where no
    scopes have a deadline set, it returns ``inf``.

    Returns:
        float: the effective deadline, as an absolute time.

async def checkpoint():
    """A pure :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoints>`.

    This checks for cancellation and allows other tasks to be scheduled,
    without otherwise blocking.

    Note that the scheduler has the option of ignoring this and continuing to
    run the current task if it decides this is appropriate (e.g. for increased
    efficiency).

    Equivalent to ``await trio.sleep(0)`` (which is implemented by calling
    :func:`checkpoint`.)

class Process(AsyncResource):
    r"""A child process. Like :class:`subprocess.Popen`, but async.

    This class has no public constructor. To create a child process, use
    `open_process`::

       process = await trio.open_process(...)

    `Process` implements the `~trio.abc.AsyncResource` interface. In order to
    make sure your process doesn't end up getting abandoned by mistake or
    after an exception, you can use ``async with``::

       async with await trio.open_process(...) as process:
           ...

    "Closing" a :class:`Process` will close any pipes to the child and wait
    for it to exit; if cancelled, the child will be forcibly killed and we
    will ensure it has finished exiting before allowing the cancellation to
    propagate.

    Attributes:
      args (str or list): The ``command`` passed at construction time,
          specifying the process to execute and its arguments.
      pid (int): The process ID of the child process managed by this object.
      stdin (trio.abc.SendStream or None): A stream connected to the child's
          standard input stream: when you write bytes here, they become available
          for the child to read. Only available if the :class:`Process`
          was constructed using ``stdin=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None.
      stdout (trio.abc.ReceiveStream or None): A stream connected to
          the child's standard output stream: when the child writes to
          standard output, the written bytes become available for you
          to read here. Only available if the :class:`Process` was
          constructed using ``stdout=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None.
      stderr (trio.abc.ReceiveStream or None): A stream connected to
          the child's standard error stream: when the child writes to
          standard error, the written bytes become available for you
          to read here. Only available if the :class:`Process` was
          constructed using ``stderr=PIPE``; otherwise this will be None.
      stdio (trio.StapledStream or None): A stream that sends data to
          the child's standard input and receives from the child's standard
          output. Only available if both :attr:`stdin` and :attr:`stdout` are
          available; otherwise this will be None.

    After construction, you can interact with the child process by writing
    data to its `~Process.stdin` stream (a `~trio.abc.SendStream`), reading
    data from its `~Process.stdout` and/or `~Process.stderr` streams (both
    `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream`\s), sending it signals using
    `~Process.terminate`, `~Process.kill`, or `~Process.send_signal`, and
    waiting for it to exit using `~Process.wait`. See `Process` for details.

    Each standard stream is only available if you specify that a pipe should
    be created for it. For example, if you pass ``stdin=subprocess.PIPE``, you
    can write to the `~Process.stdin` stream, else `~Process.stdin` will be
    ``None``.

    Args:
      command (list or str): The command to run. Typically this is a
          sequence of strings such as ``['ls', '-l', 'directory with spaces']``,
          where the first element names the executable to invoke and the other
          elements specify its arguments. With ``shell=True`` in the

          be a string, which will be parsed following platform-dependent
          :ref:`quoting rules <subprocess-quoting>`.
      stdin: Specifies what the child process's standard input
          stream should connect to: output written by the parent
          (``subprocess.PIPE``), nothing (``subprocess.DEVNULL``),
          or an open file (pass a file descriptor or something whose
          ``fileno`` method returns one). If ``stdin`` is unspecified,
          the child process will have the same standard input stream
          as its parent.
      stdout: Like ``stdin``, but for the child process's standard output
          stream.
      stderr: Like ``stdin``, but for the child process's standard error
          stream. An additional value ``subprocess.STDOUT`` is supported,
          which causes the child's standard output and standard error
          messages to be intermixed on a single standard output stream,
          attached to whatever the ``stdout`` option says to attach it to.
      **options: Other :ref:`general subprocess options <subprocess-options>`
          are also accepted.

    Returns:

    return a :class:`subprocess.CompletedProcess` instance describing
    the results.

    If cancelled, :func:`run_process` terminates the subprocess and
    waits for it to exit before propagating the cancellation, like
    :meth:`Process.aclose`.

    **Input:** The subprocess's standard input stream is set up to
    receive the bytes provided as ``stdin``.  Once the given input has
    been fully delivered, or if none is provided, the subprocess will
    receive end-of-file when reading from its standard input.
    Alternatively, if you want the subprocess to read its
    standard input from the same place as the parent Trio process, you
    can pass ``stdin=None``.

    **Output:** By default, any output produced by the subprocess is
    passed through to the standard output and error streams of the
    parent Trio process. If you would like to capture this output and
    do something with it, you can pass ``capture_stdout=True`` to
    capture the subprocess's standard output, and/or
    ``capture_stderr=True`` to capture its standard error.  Captured
    data is provided as the
    :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout` and/or
    :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stderr` attributes of the
    returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object.  The value
    for any stream that was not captured will be ``None``.
    
    If you want to capture both stdout and stderr while keeping them
    separate, pass ``capture_stdout=True, capture_stderr=True``.
    
    If you want to capture both stdout and stderr but mixed together
    in the order they were printed, use: ``capture_stdout=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``.
    This directs the child's stderr into its stdout, so the combined
    output will be available in the `~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout`
    attribute.

    **Error checking:** If the subprocess exits with a nonzero status
    code, indicating failure, :func:`run_process` raises a
    :exc:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception rather than
    returning normally. The captured outputs are still available as
    the :attr:`~subprocess.CalledProcessError.stdout` and
    :attr:`~subprocess.CalledProcessError.stderr` attributes of that
    exception.  To disable this behavior, so that :func:`run_process`
    returns normally even if the subprocess exits abnormally, pass
    ``check=False``.

    Args:
      command (list or str): The command to run. Typically this is a
          sequence of strings such as ``['ls', '-l', 'directory with spaces']``,
          where the first element names the executable to invoke and the other
          elements specify its arguments. With ``shell=True`` in the
          ``**options``, or on Windows, ``command`` may alternatively
          be a string, which will be parsed following platform-dependent
          :ref:`quoting rules <subprocess-quoting>`.
      stdin (:obj:`bytes`, file descriptor, or None): The bytes to provide to
          the subprocess on its standard input stream, or ``None`` if the
          subprocess's standard input should come from the same place as
          the parent Trio process's standard input. As is the case with
          the :mod:`subprocess` module, you can also pass a
          file descriptor or an object with a ``fileno()`` method,
          in which case the subprocess's standard input will come from
          that file.
      capture_stdout (bool): If true, capture the bytes that the subprocess
          writes to its standard output stream and return them in the
          :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stdout` attribute
          of the returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object.
      capture_stderr (bool): If true, capture the bytes that the subprocess
          writes to its standard error stream and return them in the
          :attr:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess.stderr` attribute
          of the returned :class:`~subprocess.CompletedProcess` object.
      check (bool): If false, don't validate that the subprocess exits
          successfully. You should be sure to check the
          ``returncode`` attribute of the returned object if you pass
          ``check=False``, so that errors don't pass silently.
      **options: :func:`run_process` also accepts any :ref:`general subprocess
          options <subprocess-options>` and passes them on to the
          :class:`~trio.Process` constructor. This includes the
          ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` options, which provide additional
          redirection possibilities such as ``stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``,
          ``stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL``, or file descriptors.

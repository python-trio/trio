# Experiment with generating Chrome Event Trace format, which can be browsed

#
# Things learned so far:
# - I don't understand how the ph="s"/ph="f" flow events work â€“ I think
#   they're supposed to show up as arrows, and I'm emitting them between tasks
#   that wake each other up, but they're not showing up.
# - I think writing out json synchronously from each event is creating gaps in
#   the trace; maybe better to batch them up to write up all at once at the
#   end
# - including tracebacks would be cool
# - there doesn't seem to be any good way to group together tasks based on
#   nurseries. this really limits the value of this particular trace
#   format+viewer for us. (also maybe we should have an instrumentation event
#   when a nursery is opened/closed?)
# - task._counter should maybe be public
# - I don't know how to best show task lifetime, scheduling times, and what
#   the task is actually doing on the same plot. if we want to show particular
#   events like "called stream.send_all", then the chrome trace format won't
#   let us also show "task is running", because neither kind of event is
#   strictly nested inside the other

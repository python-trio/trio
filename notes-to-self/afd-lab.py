# A little script to experiment with AFD polling.
#
# This cheats and uses a bunch of internal APIs. Don't follow its example. The
# point is just to experiment with random junk that probably won't work, so we
# can figure out what we actually do want to do internally.

# Currently this demonstrates what seems to be a weird bug in the Windows
# kernel. If you:
#
# 0. Set up a socket so that it's not writable.
# 1. Submit a SEND poll operation.
# 2. Submit a RECEIVE poll operation.
# 3. Send some data through the socket, to trigger the RECEIVE.
#
# ...then the SEND poll operation completes with the RECEIVE flag set.
#
# (This bug is why our Windows backend jumps through hoops to avoid ever
# issuing multiple polls simultaneously for the same socket.)
#
# This script's output on my machine:
#
# -- Iteration start --
# Starting a poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_SEND: 4>
# Starting a poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>
# Sending another byte
# Poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_SEND: 4>: got <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>
# Poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>: Cancelled()
# -- Iteration start --
# Starting a poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_SEND: 4>
# Starting a poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>
# Poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>: got <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1> Sending another byte
# Poll for <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_SEND: 4>: got <AFDPollFlags.AFD_POLL_RECEIVE: 1>
#
# So what we're seeing is:
#
# On the first iteration, where there's initially no data in the socket, the
# SEND completes with the RECEIVE flag set, and the RECEIVE operation doesn't
# return at all, until we cancel it.
#
# On the second iteration, there's already data sitting in the socket from the
# last loop. This time, the RECEIVE returns immediately with the RECEIVE flag
# set, which makes sense -- when starting a RECEIVE poll, it does an immediate
# check to see if there's data already, and if so it does an early exit. But
# the bizarre thing is, when we then send *another* byte of data, the SEND
# operation wakes up with the RECEIVE flag set.
#
# Why is this bizarre? Let me count the ways:
#
# - The SEND operation should never return RECEIVE.
#
# - If it does insist on returning RECEIVE, it should do it immediately, since
#   there is already data to receive. But it doesn't.
#
# - And then when we send data into a socket that already has data in it, that
#   shouldn't have any effect at all! But instead it wakes up the SEND.
#
# - Also, the RECEIVE call did an early check for data and exited out
#   immediately, without going through the whole "register a callback to
#   be notified when data arrives" dance. So even if you do have some bug
#   in tracking which operations should be woken on which state transitions,
#   there's no reason this operation would even touch that tracking data. Yet,
#   if we take out the brief RECEIVE, then the SEND *doesn't* wake up.
#
# - Also, if I move the send() call up above the loop, so that there's already
#   data in the socket when we start our first iteration, then you would think
#   that would just make the first iteration act like it was the second
#   iteration. But it doesn't. Instead it makes all the weird behavior
#   disappear entirely.
#
# "What do we know â€¦ of the world and the universe about us? Our means of
# receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding
# objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as we are constructed to see
# them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature. With five feeble senses
# we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings
# with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very
# differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of
# matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected
# with the senses we have."
